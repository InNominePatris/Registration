This is my final project of database course in my sencond year in university, i had a lot of problems with it, my professor wanted
the database in SQL Server but i made it with Postgre SQL, he bursted i do not know why. I guess sometimes people get scared of
what they do not understand. I hope you enjoy, if you have any suggestion please be free to make any changes.
